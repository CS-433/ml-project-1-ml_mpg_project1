# PROJECT 1 - TEAM MPG - COURSE OF MACHINE LEARNING 2021/2022
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Repository for the first "*Machine Learning*" course project by the *MPG* team, whose members are *Matteo Calaf√†* ([@Teocala](https://github.com/Teocala)), *Giulia Mescolini* ([@giuliamesc](https://github.com/giuliamesc)) and *Paolo Motta* ([@paolomotta](https://github.com/paolomotta)).

The task proposed is to propose a solution to the Higgs Boson Challenge (see `project1_description.pdf` for further information), in a `python` environment, with the usage of the libraries `numpy` and, for visualization, `matplotlib`.

## Data

Data are contained in the files `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
They can be downloaded from in https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/data and, to run the code, they need to be stored in the `data` folder.

## Structure of the Code

- `implementations.py` contains the implementation of 6 requested methods to train the model.
- `run.py` generates the results using the selected model to predict test data.
- `utilities.py` contains all the functions implemented for pre-processing and hyper-parameter choice.
- `plots.py` generates the exploratory plots of the training features.
- `proj1_helpers.py` contains useful functions for reading/writing on `.csv` files.

## Results

The results used for the submission on AIcrowd can be found in the folder `data`, under the name `submission.csv`.

## Report

The final 2-page report is in the `.pdf` document `report.pdf`.
